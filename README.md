## The Official  Apple Guided Tour Playground File
Uneditted and in the original state it was published, this Swift playground file is an introduction into the Swift programming language. 

Please download or clone the repo to take the guided tour, written by Swift engineers at  Apple.

This is not created by Swift Simplified and its distribution is intended to add an extra resource as a learning aid to our Swift students.

## We Created An Online Course 
We took the official [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics/), converted it into a Swift playground, simplified it, condensed it and created a short online course.. which doubles as a language handbook!

We named this product → [The Swift Handbook 📖](https://www.swiftsimplified.com/the-swift-handbook).

## Did You Know 💡

When declaring an array the last element could end with a comma?

```Swift 
let shoppingList = ["apples", "oranges", "pears",] 👈 😲
```

## Did You Know 2 💡
We can replace the need to use `self` when using optional binding to unwrap a value.

```Swift 
if let self {
    // Swift 5.7 now allows us to omit the "== self"
}

// no more
if let strongSelf = self {
    // Use the newly created constant with a strong reference to self 
}
```
😃 Good to know! Most people won't know about this new addition to the Swift language.

## How To Become A Swift Engineer
Most companies that offer iOS developer jobs simply need to maintain an existing Swift system that has previoiusly been put in place. Creating the architecture and thinking about performance can be difficult and may require some expert knowledge, but they are not the needs of most companies. In fact, if you are interested in maintaining an existing system then the technology industry will be a huge market place in which to advertise your skills. 

With the interest of both parties in mind *(the business and the employee)* having great Swift knowledge and being able to write safe code will be the biggest focus - *which is great news!* 😃🥳🎉 

This means, all you need to do is 👉 **[learn Swift!](https://www.swiftsimplified.com/the-swift-handbook)** 👈

## Why Learn Swift
To become an iOS developer with a great salary who can work anywhere in the world using only a laptop and an internet connection. 

By studying the language all of the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place. With a clear grasp of the Swift programming language it will be much easier to apply for jobs and to pass each test they provide. The rest will be provided to you as you learn whats required within that role for that specific company. 

**Step 1**: Learn Swift

**Step 2**: Get A Job  - *learn how to make apps*

**Step 3**: 🕺🏼💃🪩

## Support The Worlds no.1 Company 
Wouldn't it make sense to write software for the worlds no.1 most prifitable company? I mean.. if you want to gain a good career and live a wealthy lifestyle. 🤷🏼‍♂️

We are tyring to consolidate more than a decades commercial experience combined with the official Swift documentation into short online courses *(created for fast learning)*, so that our students can live happier and wealthier lives - simply by learning 1 language! 😎

Why not think about becoming an iOS developer making apps for Apple software. 🤔💭
