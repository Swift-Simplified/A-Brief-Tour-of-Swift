//: ## 💡 Did you Know?
//: We have an online course - it's called [The Swift Handbook](https://www.swiftsimplified.com/the-swift-handbook).
//:
//: Our handbook teaches the 13 core topics of Swift you'll need to know to become a Swift engineer. All information is taken from offical sources and experts in industry. The handbook acts as an online course, a quick-reference guide and an incredible resource when preparing for interviews too.
//:
//: Even though this course was designed and created for Junior Swift Engineers it's also great for everyone else too.
